# a3doc

The purpose of the a3doc is a technical documentation that complies with ASPICE requirements regarding the documentation and keeps the documentation lightweight so it become a helpful tool for agile development teams.

A3 = Agile, ASPICE, ASIL

## Why a new documentation approach?

Every documentation has an audience. Which audience will have the technical documentation? People who rely on the technical documentation. Developers need it to communicate their work. If new team mates join the project some time later, the documentation is used to speed up the onboarding process.

If the documentation approach brings to much overhead and it is too bulky, it will not be used that often. If it is not used often, it will diverge from the implementation and becomes useless. We all know development documentation based on Word documents stored on network drives. Developers hate to write them and they don't believe the information they find in those files, because it is outdated.


## How can the documentation become more useful and easy to use?

To make the developer's life easier, writing documentation should be as easy as writing code.

* Keep the documentation tight at the implementation
* Use the same tooling for implementation and design documentation
* Review documentation as often the implementation
